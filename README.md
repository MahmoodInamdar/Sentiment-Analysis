# Sentiment-Analysis
Using pipecat library

Here's a simplified explanation of the code:

What It Does:
The code creates an asynchronous pipeline that processes text from a CSV file, cleans it, and then determines its sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using a pre-trained Hugging Face model.

How It Works:

DataReadingProcessor:

Input: Reads a CSV file containing a column named "text" (like customer feedback).
Processing: For each row, it cleans the text by removing special characters and converting it to lowercase.
Output: The original and cleaned text are stored in a "frame" (a small data package).
SentimentAnalysisProcessor:

Input: Takes the cleaned text from the frame.
Processing: Uses a sentiment analysis model to determine the sentiment and its confidence score. If the score is between 0.40 and 0.60, it classifies the sentiment as "neutral." It also translates technical labels (like "LABEL_0") into human-friendly words (e.g., "negative").
Output: Adds the sentiment and score to the frame.
SentimentPipeline:

Combines the two processors so that each frame flows first through data reading/cleaning and then through sentiment analysis.
Running the Pipeline:

A loop creates frames, passes them through the pipeline, collects the results, and finally writes these results (text, sentiment, score) to an output CSV file.
Dependencies:
To run this code, install:

Python 3.10+
pandas (pip install pandas)
transformers (pip install transformers)
torch (pip install torch)
pipecat-ai (pip install pipecat-ai)
Why Use Pipecat?
Pipecat makes it easy to build modular and asynchronous pipelines by packaging data into "frames" that travel through different processors. This design allows you to add or remove processing steps (like extra data cleaning or logging) without rewriting everything. For more details on its modular design, see the Pipecat Docs Overview.

Future Scope:

Add More Stages: You could insert extra processors for tasks like language detection, entity recognition, or real-time logging.
Output Options: Instead of a CSV, you might send results to a database or a dashboard.
Expand Modalities: While this example works with text, the Pipecat framework supports voice, video, and images, so you could integrate those for a full multimodal system.
This pipeline is efficientâ€”it processes one row at a time to save memory and uses async methods to handle tasks concurrently, making it suitable for real-time applications.
