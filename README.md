# Sentiment-Analysis
Using pipecat library

1. Overall Purpose and Goals
The code is designed to build a compact asynchronous pipeline that:

Reads text data from a CSV file (which is assumed to contain client comments or similar brief sentences).
Prepares the text for analysis by eliminating punctuation and special characters and converting it to lowercase.
The sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) is determined using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face's transformers library.
Handles errors simply (for example, producing error messages when required columns are missing or the CSV cannot be read).
Saves results to a new CSV file.

2. Dependencies and Installation Requirements
To run this code, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

Python 3.10+ (or a compatible version)
pandas – for reading and manipulating CSV data
pip install pandas
transformers – for using Hugging Face models (such as the sentiment-analysis pipeline)
pip install transformers
torch – usually required by Hugging Face models as a backend
pip install torch
pipecat-ai – the Pipecat framework for creating modular, asynchronous pipelines
pip install pipecat-ai
The modules asyncio and re are part of Python’s standard library, so no additional installation is required.
(For more details about Pipecat and its installation, see Pipecat Docs Overview and Installation & Setup.)

3. Code Structure and Detailed Explanation
The code is divided into several key sections:

A. DataReadingProcessor (Stage 1)

Purpose:

Reads the CSV file from a given file path and preprocesses each row’s text.
Processes one row (or “frame”) at a time in an asynchronous fashion.
Key Components and Flow:

Initialization:

The constructor (__init__) takes a file path (e.g., 'input_data.csv') and stores it.
It calls the parent class initializer from FrameProcessor.

Conditional Data Load:
When processing a frame in the DOWNSTREAM direction, it checks whether the DataFrame (self.df) has already been loaded.
If not, it reads the CSV file using pd.read_csv(self.file_path).
It verifies that the CSV has a column named "text"; if not, it raises a ValueError and prints an error message.

Preprocessing:
It then creates a new column, "processed_text", by applying the preprocess_text function on the "text" column.
Row-by-Row Processing:
For each call:
It retrieves the first row (df.iloc[0]) from the DataFrame.
It then “removes” that row by reassigning self.df to contain all remaining rows.
It updates the frame’s metadata with:
frame.metadata["text"] containing the original text.
frame.metadata["processed_text"] containing the cleaned text.
Frame Propagation:
Finally, it pushes the updated frame to the next stage in the pipeline using await self.push_frame(frame, direction).
Preprocessing Function (preprocess_text):

What It Does:
Uses a regular expression to remove all characters except letters, digits, and spaces. Then, it converts the text to lowercase.
Example:
Input: "I love this Product! @#"
Output: "i love this product"

B. SentimentAnalysisProcessor (Stage 2)
Purpose:

Receives the preprocessed text from the previous processor.
Uses a Hugging Face sentiment-analysis pipeline to classify the text.
Applies a custom score-based filter for neutral sentiment and converts technical labels into human-friendly labels.
Key Components and Flow:

Initialization:

The constructor creates an instance of the Hugging Face pipeline for sentiment analysis using the model "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment".
It also initializes the parent class.
Processing (in process_frame):

Retrieves the "processed_text" from the frame’s metadata.
Passes this text to the classifier; the model returns a result with keys "label" and "score".
Custom Neutral Filter:
If the confidence score is between 0.40 and 0.60, the sentiment is set to "neutral".
Mapping Labels:
"LABEL_0" is mapped to "negative".
"LABEL_2" is mapped to "positive".
(Note: If the model returns "LABEL_1" and the score isn’t in the neutral range, it remains unchanged.)
The sentiment and score are then added to the frame’s metadata.
Finally, the frame is pushed downstream.

C. SentimentPipeline (Combining the Processors)
Purpose:

Orchestrates the two processors (data reading/preprocessing and sentiment analysis) in a sequential manner.
Inherits from BasePipeline.
Key Components and Flow:

Initialization:

Creates instances of DataReadingProcessor and SentimentAnalysisProcessor.
Stores them in a list (self._processors) and links them with _link_processors() so that the first processor has its parent set.
Processing:

Its process_frame method iterates over each processor in the pipeline.
Each processor’s process_frame method is called sequentially (using async/await).

D. Running the Pipeline (run_sentiment_analysis)
Purpose:

Acts as the entry point to execute the pipeline.
Continuously creates new frames and passes them through the pipeline until no more data is available.
Key Components and Flow:

Setup:

Defines file_path (input CSV) and output_file_path for results.
Initializes an instance of SentimentPipeline with the CSV file path.
Processing Loop:

In a loop, a new empty Frame is created.
The pipeline’s process_frame method is invoked in the DOWNSTREAM direction.
If the frame’s metadata does not include a "text" key (meaning no data was loaded), the loop breaks.
Otherwise, the original text, sentiment, and confidence score are extracted and appended to a results list.
Output:

The results list is converted into a DataFrame and saved to the specified output CSV file.
Prints a confirmation message or an error message if saving fails.


5. The Pipecat Library and Its Usage
Overview of Pipecat:

Modular Pipeline Architecture:
Pipecat provides a framework where data is encapsulated in “frames” that travel through a series of processors. Each processor (inheriting from FrameProcessor) can modify, add to, or simply pass along these frames. This design encourages modularity and reuse.

Asynchronous Processing:
With built-in support for async/await patterns, Pipecat is particularly useful in scenarios where non-blocking, real-time processing is essential—such as voice assistants or live data feeds.

Frame Management:
The Frame class is used as the data container to hold both the original text and any additional metadata (like the preprocessed text, sentiment label, and confidence score).

Processor Base Class:
Custom processors such as DataReadingProcessor and SentimentAnalysisProcessor extend FrameProcessor to implement their own logic while still adhering to the pipeline’s flow.

Pipeline Assembly:
SentimentPipeline (inheriting from BasePipeline) links the processors together, ensuring that frames are passed sequentially from data reading to sentiment analysis. The _link_processors method sets up the parent-child relationships needed for proper asynchronous propagation.


6. Future Scope
Scaling and Concurrency:
As your application grows, you might integrate additional asynchronous sources (like live social media feeds) or scale processing by running multiple instances of the pipeline concurrently.

Integration with Other AI Services:
Extend the pipeline to incorporate other natural language processing tasks (e.g., topic modeling, named entity recognition) or multimodal processing (e.g., speech-to-text, image analysis) using other Pipecat processors or third-party APIs.

Enhanced Customization:
Develop more advanced error handling, logging, and monitoring within the pipeline. For instance, you could add processors that send alerts when the sentiment analysis confidence drops below a threshold or log processing times for each stage.

Real-Time Dashboards:
Adapt the pipeline to output results in real time to a dashboard for monitoring customer sentiment or for live feedback applications.

Broader Application Domains:
While this example focuses on text sentiment analysis, the Pipecat framework’s flexibility means it could be adapted for use in voice-enabled assistants, real-time video processing, or integrated into broader conversational AI systems.

By installing the necessary dependencies (pandas, transformers, torch, and pipecat-ai) and adjusting the processors as needed, you can quickly adapt this pipeline to your specific use case while also having ample scope for future enhancements.
